## 🔒 Name Lock System

### How It Works:

1. **Unverified Users:**
   - ✅ Can change name anytime
   - ✅ Edit profile freely

2. **Individual Verified (Blue Badge):**
   - 🔒 Name locked to ID card name
   - 🚫 Cannot edit name field
   - ✅ Can still edit bio, avatar, etc.
   - ❌ If verification revoked → name unlocked

3. **Business Verified (Gold Badge):**
   - 🔒 Business name locked
   - 🚫 Cannot edit business name
   - ✅ Can edit description, website, etc.
   - ❌ If verification revoked → name unlocked

### Frontend Implementation:
```jsx
// In Profile edit form
{user.individual_verified || user.business_verification_status === 'approved' ? (
  <input
    type="text"
    value={user.verified_seller_name || user.business_name}
    disabled
    className="locked-field"
  />
) : (
  <input
    type="text"
    value={name}
    onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
  />
)}
```

---

## 🎨 Badge Display

### Individual Verified (Blue Badge):
```jsx
{user.individual_verified && (
  <span className="verified-badge blue">
    <i className="fas fa-check-circle"></i>
    Verified Seller
  </span>
)}
```

### Business Verified (Gold Badge):
```jsx
{user.business_verification_status === 'approved' && (
  <span className="verified-badge gold">
    <i className="fas fa-certificate"></i>
    Verified Business
  </span>
)}
```

### CSS Styling:

  gap: 5px;
  padding: 4px 12px;
  border-radius: 20px;
