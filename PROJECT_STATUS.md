## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Critical:
- **None currently**

### Minor:
1. **Location data incomplete**: Wards 8-32 of Kathmandu need area data
2. **Search filters**: Not yet integrated with new location hierarchy
3. **PostAd form**: Still using old location dropdown

### Technical Debt:
1. **No automated tests**: Need unit, integration, and e2e tests
2. **Error handling**: Some API endpoints lack proper error handling
3. **Documentation**: API documentation needs to be created
4. **Code duplication**: Some utility functions duplicated across files

## 📊 METRICS TO TRACK

### Current Status:

- **Total Users**: Unknown
- **Active Sellers**: Unknown
- **Categories**: ~20+ (with subcategories added)
- **Locations**: 7 provinces, 77 districts, 753 municipalities
- **Areas**: ~21 (Kathmandu wards 1-7 only)

### Target Metrics:
- Location search response time: < 200ms
- Ad search response time: < 500ms
- Page load time: < 2s
- Mobile performance score: > 90

---

## 📝 NOTES & DECISIONS

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **PostgreSQL for locations**: Chosen for relational hierarchy and JSONB support
2. **Typesense for search**: Better performance than PostgreSQL full-text for complex searches
3. **Hierarchical IDs**: Using composite IDs (e.g., 30101 = Province 3, District 01, Municipality 01)
4. **Slug-based URLs**: SEO-friendly and user-friendly URLs

### Data Modeling:
- **Location hierarchy**: 5 tiers (Province > District > Municipality > Ward > Area)
- **Areas table**: Separate table for granular locations within municipalities
- **Account types**: Enum for 'individual' vs 'business' sellers

## 🛡️ DEVELOPMENT POLICY (CRITICAL!)

**⚠️ BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING - READ THIS:**

### Golden Rules:
1. **DO NOT delete or modify ANYTHING** (files, components, functions, props, ANYTHING) without asking first
2. **All existing code has a purpose** - even if it looks "inactive" or "old"
3. **Code may be inactive** because it's planned for future use
4. **Plans change** → Code updates → Names stay same (field names might not match current purpose)
5. **Always ask before:** deleting, "cleaning up", removing "unused" code, "fixing" names
6. **When in doubt:** ASK FIRST, CODE SECOND

### Why Code Looks "Old" But Isn't:
- `business_subscription_status` → Actually stores verification status (plan changed, field reused)
- `BusinessProfile.jsx` → Actually shows verification info (component repurposed)
- Unused props → Ready for feature activation
- Commented code → Waiting for payment integration
- **What it's CALLED ≠ What it DOES**

**Why?**
- 🔮 Files may be staged for future activation
- 🚧 Code may be work-in-progress
- 🧪 Features may be experimental/testing
- 📦 Systems may be in staged rollout

**Read the full policy:** [DEVELOPMENT_POLICY.md](DEVELOPMENT_POLICY.md)

**Examples of "inactive but intentional":**
- `AdDetail.backup.jsx` - Keep for reference
- Multiple route files - Being consolidated, keep all
- Commented auth middleware - Will activate in production
- Unused database fields - Frontend pending
