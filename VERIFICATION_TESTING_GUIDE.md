## Prerequisites

### Services Running âœ…
- [ ] Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] Backend: `http://localhost:5000`
- [ ] PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Typesense (optional, for search)

# Check users table has verification columns
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -U postgres -d thulobazaar -c "\d users"

# Expected columns:
# - business_verification_status VARCHAR(20)
# - individual_verified BOOLEAN

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Badges not showing
**Check:**
1. Is backend returning verification fields?
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/ads?limit=1 | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A2 verification
```
2. Are badge images accessible?
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:5173/golden-badge.png
curl -I http://localhost:5173/blue-badge.png
```
3. Browser console errors?
   - Open DevTools â†’ Console
   - Look for 404 errors or component errors

### Issue: Verification form not showing
**Check:**
1. User is logged in?
2. User already has pending/approved status?
3. Check Dashboard component loaded:
   - F12 â†’ Console â†’ Check for React errors

### Issue: Editor can't approve
**Check:**
1. Editor is logged in with correct role?
```bash
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -U postgres -d thulobazaar -c "
SELECT id, email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'editor@thulobazaar.com';
"
```
2. Editor has editorToken in localStorage?
   - F12 â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage
   - Look for `editorToken`

### Issue: Database not updating
**Check:**
1. Database connection working?
```bash
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -U postgres -d thulobazaar -c "SELECT NOW();"
```
2. Check backend logs for SQL errors
3. Verify migrations ran:
```bash
ls /Users/elw/Documents/Web/thulobazaar/backend/migrations/
```
